The birth of TRAC RUN. A half marathon through the Lavaux Valley from Tour de Peilz to Lausanne in Western Switzerland.\n\n-------\n\n###The Start of TRAC RUN\nWhen I decided to move to Switzerland in the summer of 2013 I discovered the Lausanne Marathon whilst Googling about my new home. It looked like a fun event and sounded oddly appealing. I asked friends if they would be interested and the conversations went something like: \n\n-- Would you like to run a half marathon?\n\n-- No.\n\n-- Would you like to run a half marathon on the shores of Lake Geneva alongside these mountains?\n\n-- When?\n\n-- It isn't until the end of October... we have loads of time.\n\n-- Oh go on then... sign me up.\n\nSeeing this as an ideal way to hook people into visiting me early on I signed us up for the race. Filling in the form there was a spot for team name. In the living room of our house on Tradescant Rd we had a couple of ideals but settled for **TRAC RUN**. Tradescant Rd Athletics Club - RUN.\n<br/>\n\n###Interested? Yes. Running? Heck no.\n\nEveryone I spoke to was interested in the race. But when I mentioned that I would sign them up people were much more hesitant. \"Let me just confirm those dates before you do anything\"... \"Er... how far is a half marathon?\"... \"Don't worry I'll sign myself up\"... In the end there were just four of us who were actually going to run: me (Sam), Andrew, Rob and Alex.\n\n<br/>\n\n###Knee Injury\nAlex had issues with his knee during the year before the race. He hoped that he would still be able to train and join the race but in the weeks leading up to the event it sadly became clear that he wouldn't be able to. \n\nWith that we were down to three.\n<br/>\n\n###Playlist\nThe race playlist was put together by myself and Rob on the morning of the race.\n\nSpotify link: [LSN13 - Race Playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/sgd/playlist/1leG51L4Ct4u6sbQMwEluj)\n\n<br/>\n\n###Race Costs\nThe race cost 45 CHF (Swiss Dollar) which at the time was Â£31.25 Sterling. \n\n<br/>\n\n###Sponsors\nThe race wouldn't have been possible without the generous support of:\n\n* [Manx Telecom](http://www.manxtelecom.com)\n* [Migros](http://www.migros.ch)\n* [Lufthansa](http://www.lufthansa.com)\n* [Helsana](http://www.helsana.ch)\n\n<br/>\n\n###Race Photos\n\n<div id=\"columns\">\n<figure>\n![Andrew at Lausanne Half Marathon 2013](/content/images/2015/02/3729176_p.jpg)\n</figure>\n<figure>\n![\"Andrew\" at Lausanne Half Marathon 2013](/content/images/2015/02/3748321_p.jpg)\n</figure>\n<figure>\n![Sam at Lausanne Half Marathon 2013](/content/images/2015/02/3737282_p.jpg)\n</figure>\n<figure>\n![Rob at Lausanne Half Marathon 2013](/content/images/2015/02/3726421_p.jpg)\n</figure>\n<figure>\n![Rob at Lausanne Half Marathon 2013](/content/images/2015/02/3744352_p.jpg)\n</figure>\n<figure>\n![Rob at Lausanne Half Marathon 2013](/content/images/2015/02/3752932_p.jpg)\n</figure>\n<figure>\n![Rob at Lausanne Half Marathon 2013](/content/images/2015/02/3715521_p.jpg)\n</figure>\n<figure>\n![Rob at Lausanne Half Marathon 2013](/content/images/2015/02/3719839_p.jpg)\n</figure>\n<figure>\n![Sam at Lausanne Half Marathon 2013](/content/images/2015/02/3719266_p.jpg)\n</figure>\n<figure>\n![Sam at Lausanne Half Marathon 2013](/content/images/2015/02/3720147_p.jpg)\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n<style>\n#columns {\ncolumn-width: 320px;\ncolumn-gap: 15px;\nwidth: 90%;\nmax-width: 1100px;\nmargin: 50px auto;\n}\ndiv#columns figure {\nbackground: #fefefe;\nborder: 2px solid #fcfcfc;\nbox-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(34, 25, 25, 0.4);\nmargin: 0 2px 15px;\npadding: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px;\ntransition: opacity .4s ease-in-out;\ncolumn-break-inside: avoid;\ndisplay: inline-block;\n}\ndiv#columns figure img {\nwidth: 100%; height: auto;\nborder-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;\npadding-bottom: 15px;\nmargin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n</style>\n\n###Finisher Clips\n\n####Andrew\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/120738088\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\n####Rob\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/120738089\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n####Sam\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/120738090\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n###Medal\n<div id=\"columns\">\n<figure>\n![Lausanne Half Marathon 2013 Medal](/content/images/2015/02/lsn2013medal.png)\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n###Results\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Who</th>\n<th class=\"hideMobile\">Time</th>\n<th class=\"showMobile\">Time</th>\n<th class=\"hideMobile\">Race Day Records</th>\n<th class=\"hideMobile\">Lasting Records</th>\n<th class=\"showMobile\">Day Recs</th>\n<!--- <th class=\"showMobile\">Now Rec</th>--->\n\n</th>\n<tr>\n<td>Andrew</td>\n<td class=\"hideMobile\">2:14:55.5</td>\n<td class=\"showMobile\">2:14</td>\n<td class=\"hideMobile\"><span class=\"clubrec\">Club Record</span><br><span class=\"courserec\">Course Record</span><br><span class=\"pbrec\">Personal Best</span></td>\n<td class=\"hideMobile\"></td>\n<td class=\"showMobile\"><span class=\"clubrec\">Cl</span> <span class=\"courserec\">Co</span> <span class=\"pbrec\">PB</span></td>\n<!---<td class=\"showMobile\"></td> -->\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sam</td>\n<td class=\"hideMobile\">2:16:04.3</td>\n<td class=\"showMobile\">2:16</td>\n<td class=\"hideMobile\"><span class=\"pbrec\">Personal Best</span></td>\n<td class=\"hideMobile\"></td>\n<td class=\"showMobile\"><span class=\"pbrec\">PB</span></td>\n<!--- <td class=\"showMobile\"></td> -->\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rob</td>\n<td class=\"hideMobile\">2:17:02.9</td>\n<td class=\"showMobile\">2:17</td>\n<td class=\"hideMobile\"><span class=\"pbrec\">Personal Best</span></td>\n<td class=\"hideMobile\"><span class=\"pbrec\">Personal Best</span></td>\n<td class=\"showMobile\"><span class=\"pbrec\">PB</span></td>\n<!--- <td class=\"showMobile\"><span class=\"pbrec\">PB</span></td> -->\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<br/>\n\n###Official Results Screenshot\n![Official Lausanne Half Marathon Results](/content/images/2015/02/2013LSN_Results.png)\n\n<br/>\n###Race Report\nThe day after the race I wrote this update to Alex who had unfortunately had to duck out of the race:\n\n- Conditions were near perfect.

Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're live! Nice.

Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>\n\n<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Item number one</li>\n<li>Item number two\n<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>\n<li>A final item</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>or with numbers!</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>\n<li>Drink the milk  </li>\n<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"links\">Links</h3>\n\n<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whataboutimages\">What about Images?</h3>\n\n<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png\" alt=\"The Ghost Logo\" /></p>\n\n<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quoting\">Quoting</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"workingwithcode\">Working with Code</h3>\n\n<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>\n\n<pre><code>.awesome-thing {\n    display: block;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"readyforabreak\">Ready for a Break?</h3>\n\n<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"advancedusage\">Advanced Usage</h3>\n\n<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>\n\n<p><input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" /></p>\n\n<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think
